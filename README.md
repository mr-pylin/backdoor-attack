# Backdoor-Attack (Archived)
This repository has been archived and is no longer maintained. For the latest implementations about Backdoor Learning in DNN, please visit my new repository [backdoor-toolbox](https://github.com/mr-pylin/backdoor-toolbox).

## Overview
This repository contains code for a training-time data poisoning attack on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It is based on the findings of the paper titled "Anti-Backdoor Learning: Training Clean Models on Poisoned Data," which can be accessed via the arXiv repository at https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.11571.

The file `./utils/wresnet.py` is derived from [here](https://github.com/bboylyg/ABL/blob/main/models/wresnet.py).

## Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
